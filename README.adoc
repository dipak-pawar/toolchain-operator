Operator to enable CodeReady Toolchain on OSD clusters

== Overview
To enable CodeReady Toolchain on any Openshift cluster, we need one time configuration setup which includes following things:

    * creation of service account with required roles
    * creation of oauth client
    * finding routing subdomain
    * finding cluster name and publicly available API URL

Once, we have above resources, we'll need to update this cluster information to the cluster management service, so that it can provision namespaces/projects to required users on this new cluster.

So in short this operator has to create required resources, find required cluster configuration details and update it to cluster management service.

Btw, cluster management service is interested in following information.

== Building from source [[building]]

The following guide is mainly targeted towards a Linux machine.

=== Prerequisites [[prerequisites]]

You need to install:

* `go` (>= v1.11)
* `git`
* `mercurial`
* `make`
* `operator-sdk` (>= v0.4.0)

==== Check your Go version [[check-go-version]]

Run the following command to find out your Go version.

----
$ go version
----

*You must at least have Go version 1.11.*

See <<fetch-dependencies>> to see an explanaition on how we deal with
dependencies.

==== Install dep [[dep-setup]]

This project uses https://github.com/golang/dep[dep] as a package manager for Go.
Running the `make deps` command will install `dep` in `$GOPATH/bin` if it's not already available on your system.

==== Installing Operator-SDK
Follow https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#quick-start[this] guide to install operator-sdk

=== Get the code [[get-the-code]]

Assuming you have Go installed and configured (have `$GOPATH` setup) here is
how to build.

Check out the code

----
$ git clone https://github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator
----

=== Build [[build]]

Like most other projects, this one depends on various other projects that need
to be downloaded.


To fetch the dependencies and finally build the project you can type `make build` in a freshly clone repository of this project.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator
$ make build
----

==== Special make targets

There is no need to fetch the dependencies, or re-generate code every time you
want to compile. That's why we offer special `make` targets for these topics:

 * <<fetch-dependencies>>
 * <<build>>
 * <<clean>>
 * <<test>>

===== Fetch dependencies [[fetch-dependencies]]

This will download all the dependencies for this project inside a directory
called `vendor`. This way we can ensure that every developer and our CI system
is using the same version.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator
$ make deps
----

For dependency management of `go` packages we use https://github.com/golang/dep[`dep`].

The file `Gopkg.toml` contains all dependencies. If you want to understand the format for this file, look link:https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/Gopkg.toml.html[here].


===== Build [[build]]

If you want to just build the toolchain operator, run `make build`.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator
$ make build
----

===== Clean [[clean]]

This removes all downloaded dependencies, all generated code and compiled
artifacts.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator
$ make clean
----

===== Tests [[test]]

Here's how to run all available tests. All tests will check all Go packages
except those in the `vendor/` directory.

====== unit-tests
Unit tests have the minimum requirement on time and environment setup.

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator
make test-unit
```

====== e2e-tests

*TL; DR*
```bash
make minishift-start
eval $(minishift docker-env)
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator
make test-e2e
```

E2E tests are verifying successful deployment of Toolchain Operator and creation of required resources. End To end tests demand openshift cluster to be up and running.

However you can run minishift which is single node openshift cluster. You can check it using `minishift status`. If not then start it using `make minishift-start` target.

After successfully starting minishift, configure your shell to use docker daemon from minishift using `eval $(minishift docker-env)`.

Now it's time to run E2E tests for `toolchain-operator` which will create it's required resources from `deploy/test/` on OpenShift use following command:
```
make test-e2e
```

This make target is building new docker image `$(DOCKER_REPO)/$(IMAGE_NAME):test`(e.g. `quay.io/openshiftio/toolchain-operator:test`) which is used in the operator's deployment manifests in e2e tests.

Also remember that it uses the `system:admin` account for creating all required resources from `deploy/test` directory.

all::
To run both, the unit and the end to end tests you can run
+
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator
$ make test-all
----

== Running On Minishift
Follow https://github.com/fabric8-services/toolchain-operator/blob/master/minishift/README.md[minishift] guide to run operator on minishift

== Developer
=== Code formatting

To check if the code is properly formatted run:
```
$ make check-go-format
```

To format the code:
```
$ make format-go-code
```
